            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>COurteous Reader, There wanting room at the concluſion of this Diſcourſe to make a Poſtſcript, I am neceſſitated to make it upon the back of the Title page, that being the laſt printed; and to acquaint thee, that divers weeks agoe, this diſcouſe was all in a manner printed, which I have been neceſſitated to keep in ever ſince, by reaſon of a little liberty I obtained of the day time to viſit my ſick and diſtreſſed family, which by ſicknes have been ſorely afflicted by the wiſe hand of him that diſpenſeth all his dealings to thoſe that truly know him in mercy and loving kindneſſe, with the bowels of a loving father; yea, in afflictions (his ſeeming frowns) hath that end in them to draw the ſouls of his nigher and cloſer to himſelf, and that thereby they may truly and ſubſtantially ſee that in the naked injoyment of himſelf, that is not to be found in all earthly or creature ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or delights; and his wiſe hand having thought it fit to exerciſe my faith and pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by taking away both my Sons from me, who were the greateſt part of my earthly delight in this world, and brought my wife and daughter even to deaths door; which af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction I muſt truly acknowledge made me unfit to think almoſt of any earthly thing, and became unto me a greater tryall of my dependence upon God, then ever I had in my life; eſpecially, being not alone by my ſelf, but a company like <hi>Jobs,</hi> with many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bitter ones: but my ſweet father letting me ſee his hand in it, and being merciful to me in ſparing and recovering my wife and daughter, and hath as it were brought my ſpirit to its ſelfe, which hath made me wait for a righteous and hoped for compoſure betwixt my unrighteous adverſaries and my ſelf, and (which if it had come I had burnt this diſcourſe) in whoſe promiſes I conſtantly find nothing but meer deluſions: and therefore am compelled in my own ſpirit to let this fly; and the rather, becauſe Sir <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thur Ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>Now I ſay, conſidering that which is before declared, I cannot upon any terms in the world, either with ſafety, juſtice or conſcience, as things ſtand with me at preſent, give my conſent, but hinder as much as I am able, all addreſſes from you, or any others for me, that ſhall own thoſe uſurping Tyrants as a Parliament, eſpecially by Petition. <hi>Which was a courſe</hi> (ſaith the pretended Parliament Solicitor againſt the King, in his Caſe ſtated, <hi>page</hi> 24.) <hi>which Gods people did not take with</hi> Rehoboam, <hi>for they never Petitioned him</hi> (although he was their lawful and ſupreme Magiſtrate) <hi>but adviſed him; he refuſing their counſel, and hearkened to young and wicked Counſellors, and they cry out, To thy Tents O Iſrael, and made quick and ſhort work of it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I ſhall rather deſire and adviſe you; by Letter like your ſelves, addreſs your ſelves to the Lord <hi>Fairfax;</hi> by the ſword of whom and his Souldiers, I am now in priſon for my honeſty and innocency, and nothing elſe, and demand my liberty of him; if he refuſe, print it, and do as God, and Reaſon ſhall direct you; for it was his and his Souldiers force that fetcht me out of my Bed, the 28 of <hi>March,</hi> 1649. without all ſhadow of Law or Juſtice, <hi>and againſt the tenor of all their own Declarations;</hi> the particular pages of which, you may read in my following Letter to Mr. <hi>Holland, page</hi> 5. And by force of Arms, carryed me to <hi>Whitchal,</hi> and then to <hi>Derby</hi> houſe, before a company of men, that in Law had no more power to commit my body to priſon, then ſo many theeves and robbers up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Suiters</hi> Hill have; who by the Rules of their own wills <hi>(as in the ſecond Edition of the Picture of them, I have fully declared)</hi> ſent me by force of Arms to the Tower; for all my ſhort eternity in this world.</p>
            <p>But I intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider that I cannot adviſe you to make addreſs to him, as the General of the Nations forces, for he is no ſuch thing; but is meerly a great Tyrant, ſtanding by the power of his own will, and a ſtrong ſword, born by his vaſſals, ſlaves and creatures, having no commiſſion to be General, <hi>either from Law, the Parliament, or from the prime Laws of Nature and Reaſon.</hi>

            <p>For Firſt, where he was firſt made General by both Houſes of Parliament, it was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly againſt the letter of the Law, which action cannot be juſtified, either before God or man, but in caſe of extream neceſſity; and for the accompliſhment of a univerſall righteous end, <hi>viz.

            <p>But ſecondly, in refuſing to disband, &amp;c. he hath rebelled againſt his Parliament com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and thereby deſtroyed and annihilated it; And at <hi>New-Market Heath, the fifth of June</hi> 1647. betook himſelf to the prime Laws of Nature, and by common conſent of his Officers and Souldiers became their General, <hi>and entred into a ſolemn and mutuall ingagement before God, and one another,</hi> for the accompliſhment of thoſe righteous ends

therein contained, for the good of the Kingdom and themſelves, by ſubſcribing his name, or at leaſt expreſly aſſenting thereunto, and approving thereof with ſolemn ingagement, as is at large Printed in the Armies Book of Declarations, <hi>p.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. by the very letter of which, he, nor his Officers could not govern the Army jointly or ſeverally, by the former Rules or Articles of Martiall Law. <hi>no nor ſo much as make an Officer of the meaneſt quality, nor put forth any publike Declaration, nor treat with, nor conclude with any in reference to the Army, but by the joynt advice and approbation of their new erected and eſtabliſhed councel of Adjurators,</hi> which for order and methods ſake, the General was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted to convene and call together, as the King formerly was Parliaments, or the Lord Mayor of <hi>London</hi> Common Councels; and yet notwithſtanding he and his Officers, like a generation of moſt perfidious, falſe, and faithleſs men, broke all this ingage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to pieces, within leſs then twenty dayes after it was made, and ſo annihilated and deſtroyed his power, authority, or commiſſion, flowing from the conſent of the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, before he had really accompliſhed any one thing, he, or they ingaged for, and hath ſince two ſeverall times, put a nullity, or force, upon his originall Creators, Lords and Maſters, the Parliament.</p>
            <p>And that he and his Officers broke their forementioned ſolemn ingagements in ſo ſhort a time I prove fully out of their own book of Declarations, in which <hi>page</hi> 36. to 46 <hi>I finde a Declaration, dated the</hi> 14. <hi>of June,</hi> 1647. <hi>made and publiſhed by his Excellency Sir</hi> Thomas Fairfax, <hi>with the Officers and Souldiers of his Army;</hi> (mark it well) for in the very words of it, it is, in Excellency worth all the Declarations that ever the Army made ſince: and in <hi>page</hi> 47. to 50. <hi>I finde a generall charge againſt the eleven Members, with a paper delivered with it to the Parliaments Commiſſioners at St.</hi> Albans, <hi>the</hi> 17. <hi>June</hi> 1647 <hi>by the appointment of his Excellency Sir</hi> T.

The General, and twenty eight Grandee, and creature Officers, publiſh a Remonſtrance to the Kingdom, and that in the name of the Army; in which baſe and abominable apoſtacie they continued, without ever wiping their mouths, or recanting what they had ſo unjuſtly done, as the whole tenor of their Book of Declarations doth declare; yea when the particular charge againſt the eleven Members comes from them, it comes onely in the name of the General, and his Councel of War, <hi>page</hi> 94. yea, and all this, with ten times more (as I beleeve the world will ſhortly and fully ſee) <hi>was done in despite of the Adjutators, or conſent of the Regiments, Troops, or Companies;</hi> for all thoſe two grand and lying Apoſtates (<hi>Cornet</hi> Den, <hi>and Parſon</hi> John Can, <hi>a late cheat at Amſterdam</hi>) confident affirmations to the contrary in their late Printed lying books, intituled the <hi>Levellers</hi> Deſign, <hi>page</hi> 4, 5. and the ſecond part of the Diſcoverer, <hi>page</hi> 5. 6. where they aver, <hi>That the councel of Adjutators, eſtabliſhed by the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſolemn ingagement, was diſſolved and made null by the ſame power by which they had their conſtitution; and that it was done by a Petition to the Generall from moſt of the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> But although I iudg the two <hi>forementioned lying baſe Apoſtates,</hi> to be ſo abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minably vile, that I judg not my excrements mean enough upon equal terms to ballance againſt them; yet knowing the affairs of the Army then ſo extraordinarily well as I do, I will ballance life againſt life, that neither they, nor any man breathing can produce a Petition ſo much as from one ſingle Troop or Company, <hi>much leſs from a Regiment,</hi> and therefore much leſs from the greateſt part of the Regiments, both of Horſe and Foot, for calling home the Adjutators, before the Gen. and his Officers had, as is before mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,

               <hi>broke in pieces the ſolemn engagement again and again</hi> (and invaſion of Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges was the true declared ground and cauſe of all the late wars with the late beheaded King, and is really the originall ground of moſt (if not all) the cruell wars in the world) But if the Souldiers had made ſuch, a Petition (which they never did) it were not much materiall I think, for they ingaged ſomething to and for the Kingdom, in reference to the ſetlement of their Liberties and Freedoms, which I am ſure they in no one title ever accompliſhed or performed, and therefore till that be done, they can not rationally or juſtly abſolve themſelves from the true intent or meaning of that engagement.</p>
            <p>But I wiſh thoſe Champions for lies and Apoſtaſie, would inſtance the place where, the time when, and the Regiments that ſubſcribed and delivered ſuch a Petition, and deal ingeniouſly with the world, whether it were a free act, or a compulſive one, wrought <hi>underhand, by all the ſnares, policies, tricks, gins, and ſlights, that poſſible the Officers could invent, without or below a viſible and compulſive force,</hi> which can never of right unty that knot; Sure I am, divers of the Adiutators, &amp;c. ſent ſeverall complaints to me, &amp;c. to the lower from St. <hi>Albans;</hi> immediatly after the ſolemn ingagement was made, <hi>complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning that Cromwel, Ireton, &amp;c.</hi> (one of which two pen'd this engagement) <hi>would needs then by force and frowns totally break and diſſolve it;</hi> of which baſeneſs (though then we were not viſibly faln out) I told <hi>Cromwel</hi> very freely and plainly of, as appears by my Letters to him of the 22 of <hi>June,</hi> 1647 and the 1 of <hi>July</hi> 1647. and in my Adviſe to the Adiutators of the 16 of <hi>July,</hi> 1647. All which I cauſed immediatly after to be Printed in my Book, <hi>called</hi> Jonahs <hi>cries out of the Whales belly,</hi> and the like in my little Book, <hi>called the Juglers Diſcovered;</hi> and I am ſure it was <hi>Auguſt</hi> following, when the Armies Head quarters were at <hi>Kingſton,</hi> where <hi>Cromwel</hi> begun to be afraid of the Adiutators ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehending his underhand and night Juglings with the King, <hi>to ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>But from what hath been already ſaid, (and in time will ſpeedily be declared) <hi>it is evident that the General and the Officers at St.</hi> Albans <hi>broke their ſolemn engagement with their Souldiers and the Kingdom, immediatly after it was made, and tyrannically and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly invaded their Rights and Freedoms,</hi> which bred heart-burnings, and thoſe diviſions which the publique enemy (ſo called) took the advantage of, and ſo came on the wars; God ever after their abominable and villanous appoſtacy, filling their hands with trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and confuſions, beſides loſs of reputation and good name, upon whoſe ſcore alone lies the true guilt of all the blood-ſhed in the laſt years war, and of all the miſeries that ſince have befaln <hi>Ireland</hi>

Yet ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>contrary to my many earneſt deſires,</hi> and without my privity, ſhe hath lately been with your ſelf at the Houſe door, about my liberty, who as ſhe relates unto me, <hi>was very high with her;</hi> as though I had committed againſt you, <hi>little leſs then the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, that can never be pardoned;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in vindication of my own innocency, and integrity, I cannot chuſe, but take this opportunity, to make a fair and ingenuous <hi>propoſition</hi> unto you, that you cannot refuſe, if you have but a grain of Ingenuity left in you, which is this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That if your Houſe pleaſe to chuſe two men, I will chuſe two more, and they ſhall have power by majority of voyces, in caſe they cannot agree to chuſe an um<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, finally to decide the buſineſs betwixt us; and I will be content they ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point</hi> Cromwel, Ireton, Bradſhaw, <hi>and all the Orators, or Pleaders;</hi> they had againſt the King, and the beheaded Lords, or as many of them as they pleaſe, <hi>to plead againſt me; and I will have none but my ſelf ſingly, to plead my own cauſe againſt them all; and I will venture ſo far as my</hi> 24 <hi>or</hi> 25 <hi>hundred pounds, yet in your hands, will amount unto, five hundred pounds to one hundred, yea, and my head, to the head of him, that in your Houſe principally cauſed my impriſonment, or any reaſonable conſiderable balance; Provided, the debate may be publike, and that I may have free liberty to ſpeak for my ſelf; and provided, the Scripture, the Book of Statutes,</hi> Cooks <hi>Inſtitutes,</hi> (publiſhed by your ſelves for good Law,) <hi>the Parliaments and Armies, Primitive, Printed Declarations, may be the Witneſſes and Jury men on both ſides; for the aforeſaid Arbitrators, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire, to guide their Judgments by. And if I cannot maintain mine own Innocency, and Integrity, againſt all that can, upon the Rules aforeſaid, be ſaid againſt me, and it be not ſo determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, and judged by the major part of the Arbitrators, or <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>mpire, choſen as before is expreſſed, I will loſe and for fit all I have, yea, and my life to boot:</hi> And I think this is ſo fair, That no rational man under Heaven, can condemn it, or me, if it be refuſed.

            <p>HAving the ſame day this Letter was dated, ordered my wife, with another Friend, to carry it to Maſter <hi>Holland,</hi> and deliver it to his own hands; at her coming home at night, ſhe tells me, That Maſter <hi>Hunt</hi> (one that is very great with <hi>Cromwel</hi> and Maſter <hi>Holland,</hi> and one that formerly I have been very great and familiar with) had been to ſeek her at <hi>Wincheſter</hi> Houſe, the day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; and meeting with her at <hi>Weſtminſter,</hi> the 26 day of <hi>June,</hi> he told her, as ſhe told me, to this effect, That he had been to ſeek her, to know how much money of my three thouſand pounds was remaining, that ſo he might ſpeedily certifie ſome Parliament men, who were reſolved to help me ſpeedily to all my money down, and my liberty alſo; which did ſo rejoyce her, and overcome her facile credulity, That ſhe judged it not convenient to deliver my Letter, according to my earneſt deſire to her, leſt it might provoke, and came in all haſte home to me for my Ordinance and Accounts; which to pleaſe her, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly I ſent, with a Letter to Maſter <hi>Hunt,</hi> and a Printed ſheet of Paper, which lively ſtates my <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> ſufferings; ſome hundreds of which, I delivered to the Members at their door, the fourth of <hi>September,</hi> 1648.

and told me of it, of which I no ſooner heard, but immediatly by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, of my own accord, I poſted by boat to Weſtminſter, and coming up to the Houſe of Commons door about three or four a clock, I found the Houſe to be riſen, and meeting with ſome of my friends and acquaintance at the door, I told them there, I underſtood <hi>the Houſe of Commons had again dealt worſe with me then the Heathen and Pagan</hi> Romans <hi>dealt with</hi> Paul, <hi>who when his adverſaries deſired Judgment againſt him, they told them, that it was not the maner of the</hi> Romans <hi>to judge or condemn any man before he which is accuſed have his accuſer face to face, and have liberty to anſwer for himſelf concerning the crime laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him,</hi> Act. 25. and yet upon a bare accuſation of a ſingle Prieſt (as I was informed) they had again committed me to the Tower <hi>before they heard me ſpeak one word for myſelf,</hi> in which (I told my friends freely and openly they had outſtript the Heathen and Pagan <hi>Romans</hi> in Injuſtice, who though <hi>Paul</hi> by <hi>Tertullus</hi> the Orator, <hi>was accuſed for a peſtilent fellow, and a mover of ſedition among all the</hi> Jews <hi>through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the world, and a Ringleader of the Sect of the</hi> Nazarens, Acts 24. yet they would not condemn him before they heard him face to face ſpeak for himſelf.</p>
               <p>And I further told them, this unjuſt proceeding of the Houſe of Commons againſt me, was but <hi>juſt the ſame unrighteous meaſure that they had meted out before unto me,</hi> for about two years ago I had come Poſt from Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> Army, to bring them glad tidings of his routing of General <hi>Gorings</hi> Army at <hi>Lamport</hi> in <hi>Somerſetſhire,</hi> and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing daily waiting at the Houſe door, I was a few dayes after, by the <hi>Speakers</hi> means (as I have been ſince largely told) Voted upon a bare ſuggeſtion to Priſon, <hi>without the Houſe ever ſo much as calling in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended accuſers (viz.</hi> Dr. <hi>Baſtwick,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Edward King,</hi> with whom for divers moneths before, I had not, to the beſt of my remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, changed ſo much as one word) <hi>or ever ſo much as calling me in, though then at their door to ſpeak one word for my ſelf,</hi> they Voted, and Reſolved upon the Queſtion, <hi>That I ſhould be committed to priſon till they pleaſe to releaſe me, without telling me to this hour wherefore they impriſoned me;</hi> and from their Serjeant at Arms, toſſed and tumbled me to <hi>Newgate,</hi> for refuſing (to make of one of their Committees, a High Commiſſion, or Spaniſh Inquiſition,) to anſwer <hi>(againſt all Law and Juſtice)</hi> to their Interrogatories: And then when they had me at <hi>Newgate, made an Order of their Houſe, to arraign me at Newgate Seſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for no leſs then my life;</hi> and Ordered the prime Lawyers about <hi>London, viz.</hi> Maſter <hi>Bradſhaw,</hi> Maſter <hi>Steel,</hi> Maſter <hi>Walker, &amp;c.</hi> to be my proſecuters, and by a <hi>law-quirk,</hi> if it were poſſible, to take away my life from me: And yet for all that, they being ſufficiently baffled, by my own pen, and the pens of my Friends, they ſent me One hundred pounds to <hi>Newgate</hi> (as may be ſuppoſed) to help to bear my charges,

               <p>I further told my Friends then, and there.

               <p>And the ſubſtance of that Diſcourſe was, to convince our ſcrupling
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:116227:13"/>
friends or friend, <hi>That the Kingdom was in exceeding great diſtractions, and the people under general Oppreſſions and Burthens, and trading generally decayed; which had occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mighty heart-burnings, and dividings of Spirit amongſt the people; and the preſent Houſe of Commons</hi> (though ſufficiently corrupted) <hi>was the viſibly beſt, and juſteſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritie that was extant in</hi> England; <hi>the overthrowing of which (as things ſtood) would bring in ſuch a preſent Inunda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of miſery and confuſion, into the whole Kingdom, that there would be nothing in the eye of Reaſon, but cutting of throats every where, and all return into its firſt Chaos, and the longeſt Swords to be Judges of all, and we might be as ſoon deſtroyed in ſuch a general confuſion, and hurly burly, as any others. And therefore, I and my friend preſſed, That if they either wiſhed well unto themſelves, or their Native Countrey, they were tied in duty and conſcience, to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of their power, to preſerve the Intereſt and Being of the Houſe of Commons</hi> (ſo long as it continued a Houſe;) <hi>and yet in ſuch a way, That they might not invaſſalize the people: Both of which, they were told was provided for in this Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and to do any thing that might pull down or deſtroy the preſent Power and Being of the Houſe of Commons, in the eyes of the people, before things are in ſome ſettledneſs</hi> (which would ſufficiently be done if they ſhould diſclaim them as unworthy to be Petitioned unto any more) <hi>were to undo and deſtroy our ſelves, eſpecially conſidering, That they had ſo lately engaged ſo high againſt the King, and the</hi> Scots; <hi>and therefore it behoved us not ſo to act, as to increaſe their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries, but rather to ſtrengthen their hands, and the rather at this juncture of time; and yet ſo to do it, as that the generality of the Commons of</hi> England, <hi>might be gainers by it, in the knowledg of their particular Liberties; that ſo if it were poſſible, they might be united therein, and might thereupon, as one man in the Spirit of Engliſhmen, ſtand up, and live, and die each with other, againſt all Forraign Intereſts what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as I further told my ſaid acquaintance and friends, That I was
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:116227:13"/>
confident there was never any one Diſcourſe in <hi>England, wherein the true and juſt Intereſt of the Houſe of Commons, was more firmly, cordially and ſtrongly maintained, then in that:</hi> And if they ſhould puniſh me for my actions or ſpeeches at that meeting, I ſhould be puniſhed for doing as great (and as real) a peece of ſervice to the Intereſt of the Houſe of Commons, (and conſequently to the Intereſt of the Kingdom) as ever was done in any meeting by any Member of the Houſe. And this I told them, I doubted not but to make as evident as the Sun, when it ſhined, if the Houſe would hear me but ſpeak for my ſelf. At which, my Friends were very much refreſhed, conſidering ſo deſperate things were charged upon me by the Prieſt.</p>
               <p>So enquiring if any of them could tell me where Maſter <hi>Sergeant</hi> was, I was anſwered, <hi>He was with the Speaker, and the Earl of</hi> Mancheſter, <hi>in the Queens Court;</hi> and going up thither to finde him, I found him ready with his Mace, to uſher the Keepers of the Great Seal unto the Chancery Court. So ſtanding in their way, as they were to come out, I had a minde to face them, to ſee how they would look upon me; and after they paſſed by, I could ſee the Speaker lay his head to the Earl of <hi>Mancheſters.</hi> Whereupon, they both turned about, and ſtared wiſhfully upon me, and ſo did the three Judges that followed them, which were, if I miſtake not, Judg <hi>Rowls,</hi> Judg <hi>Pheſant,</hi> and Baron <hi>Atkins;</hi> and I looked as wiſhfully upon them, with an undaunted countenance, thereby demonſtrating that unſpotted Innocency chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my heart, and ſo down ſtairs they went, and I followed them at their heels to the Chancery, with an earneſt deſire, to know the matter more fully of Maſter <hi>Sergeant,</hi> and truly to know what their Houſe had done upon it, who within a little while, coming out of the Court, I had my opportunity to ſpeak with; who looked very ſtrangely upon me, <hi>as though I were now a deſtroyed man;</hi> at which, I ſmiled, and told him, If ever the Houſe of Commons in their lives, had true ground and cauſe to thank me for any ſervice, that ever I had done them with my tongue, <hi>it was for that nights Diſcourſe, and my there pleading their Cauſe and Intereſt.</hi> And much more Diſcourſe to the ſame purpoſe (as is before mentioned) we had, but I grated very much <hi>upon Maſter Speakers unjuſt and unrighteous dealing with me.</hi> And I told him, I conceived this was one of his new plots, or the Earl of <hi>Mancheſters:</hi> For guilty conſcienced men, are always afraid of the ſhakings of an Aſpine-leaf; and would frame and contrive, out of their own brains new plots, and then themſelves bring them to light, as contrived againſt the State and Parliament, <hi>That ſo they might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by blaſt all ſorts of men that were likely to pinch them.</hi> And truely I told him, they were to mine own knowledg, very good at theſe tricks, for I knew them both of old; at which he was diſtaſted, and told me, <hi>the Houſe had taken off my former Order for my going abroad, and had
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:116227:14"/>
remanded me to the Tower again,</hi> and had ſent an Order to the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of the Tower, to morrow morning, to bring me up to their Bat as a priſoner: I told him, it was but like all the reſt of their juſt deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, towards me; and in this I told him, they cleerly demonſtrated to the whole Kingdom, <hi>That they had leſs Juſtice within their breſts, then was in the Heathen, and Pagan Roman Judges, that had nothing but the light of Nature to guide them in their judgment; and yet would not condemn</hi> Paul <hi>before they heard him, though his Adverſaries laid greater things to his charge, then all the men in</hi> England <hi>are able juſtly to pretend againſt me.</hi> And as for my going again priſoner to the Tower, I told him, I would now never go upon the old ſcore <hi>voluntary,</hi> while my eyes were open. And I further told him to this effect, That if their hearts were not totally hardened, <hi>and their ſouls ſcaled up to do wickedneſs for ever,</hi> they would bluſh for ſhame, ſo much as to talk of committing me to priſon, before now <hi>after above ſeven yeers waiting upon them, they had done me ſome reaſonable proportion of Juſtice;</hi> but now again to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me to priſon, after eleven or twelve yeers (as heavy) ſufferings, as ever Engliſhman (that I read of) endured; to the exhauſting me of all that ever I have in the world, yea, and more too, by running into debt to buy me bread, and to keep almoſt three thouſand pounds of my Corn from me by force and violence, and to commit me to priſon again, without any maner of proviſion in the world, for me and mine to live upon (after I have made ſo many mournful cryes and moans un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.) What is this elſe, but to be more cruel then the very <hi>Cannibals</hi> themſelves? who always feed fat thoſe men that they intend to eat, and devour; and were it not more juſtice in them, <hi>to cauſe their Guard of Halberders, to knock my brains out,</hi> and ſo put a period to my days, and miſeries, then again to ſend me priſoner to the Tower, either to be ſtarved, or eat the ſtone walls (which is impoſſible.) For as the Spirit of God ſaith by <hi>Jeremy</hi> in his Lamentations, Chap. 4.9. <hi>Better are they that die by the ſword, then they that be ſlain with hunger:</hi> And he gives this Reaſon of it, <hi>For the laſt pines away, ſtricken through for want of the Fruits of the Field; whereas he that is ſlain quickly, endures little or no pain.</hi> And how they can conceive in the eye of Reaſon, (laying all things together) how I ſhould thus long live, and ſubſiſt without miracle, (eſpecially, conteſting with all the great corrupt Intereſts of <hi>England,</hi> who have ſcores and hundreds of mercinary, pencionary emiſſaries, in the City and Countrey, with their lyes and falſhoods, to rob me of my Reputation and Credit; and with their groundleſs reproaches, to beſpatter me, and make me as black as a Chimny Sweeper, and render me as a man not fit to live in civil or moral Society) is beyond my Reaſon to apprehend.</p>

                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:116227:15"/>But in the concluſion of my diſcourſe, I told Mr Sergeant, that though I would not willingly go to the <hi>Tower,</hi> yet I would promiſe him willingly and voluntarily of mine owne accord to come to morrow morning, (<hi>being Wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſday,</hi> 19th. of <hi>Jan.</hi> 1647.) to the Houſe of Commons, and if they would give me but fair play, and leave at their Bar freely to ſpeake for my ſelfe, I doubt not but to make my baſe and lying accuſer (for all the ſtart he had got of me) aſhamed of what he had done: ſo after I had a little faced the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners of the Great Seal fitting in open Court, and talked a little with ſome Parliament-men, and given them three or four laſhes, <hi>for their ungrave, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt, and light credulity,</hi> away to my Lodging in <hi>London</hi> I came, and being up very betimes the next morning, to meet ſome underſtanding friends, to confer how, and after what manner the buſineſſe by me ſhould be carried at the Houſe; this man, and the other man, threw in very ſollid adviſe, and preſſed me to a careful and diligent obſervation, but I bid them hold their peace, and talke no more of it to me; for I neither could nor would obſerve their directions; for I told them to this effect, <hi>my heart was all one fire, and my ſoul did thirſt and long to be amongſt the Parliament-men, that in the might and ſtrength of my ſtrong God, I might talke to them,</hi> and I told them my old refuge in all ſuch caſes as this is, was the 10th of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and I cared for no other counſellor; neither in this caſe could I regard any but his, who was, and is, the author of that, who in all ſuch caſes, <hi>had commanded me to take no thought how, or what to ſpeake; promiſing that it ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven me in that ſame hour, what I ſhall ſpeake, for</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is not you that ſpeak, but the ſpirit of your Father that ſpeaketh in you;</hi> unto which, an eminent man in the company replied, <hi>he lik'd it well, but yet for all that he lov'd to uſe meanes;</hi> But I told him, I lik'd that wel too, but in this caſe, not knowing what they wil ſay unto me, or lay to my charge, <hi>all diſcourſes to me below the tenth of Mathew was to no purpoſe,</hi> and therefore I preſſed againe to be gone to <hi>Weſtminſter, for my ſoul longed to be amongſt them,</hi> being <hi>brim-full, and ready for want of vent to overflow;</hi> deſiring at preſent, nothing ſo much from God, as to order their hearts ſo, as to cauſe them to give me free leave to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>So preparing for the journey, I arrived with other of my friends at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and being not long <hi>at the Houſe door,</hi> (where was many friends come downe from <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Southwark,</hi> to hear and ſee how things went) I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed my ſelf to the Sergeant of the Houſe, to let him know I was there to tend upon the Houſes pleaſure; And he immediately after came out with his Mace, and CALLED FOR Mr. MASTERSON, THE JUDAS PRIEST, and my ſelfe; ſo in we went, and alſo the Lieutenant of the <hi>Tower</hi> as <hi>my guardian,</hi> and having given them that due reſpect, that I conceived is due unto their juſt and true authority, (though I owe little or none unto the perſons that ſat there, by reaſon of their groſſe abuſing and moſt abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable of their righteous authority) the thing that paſſed, ſo near as my memory to the utmoſt punctilio will ſerve me, I ſhal faithfully relate unto you. Upon our comming to the Bar, where both my lying ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer and my ſelfe ſtood, the <hi>Speaker</hi> ſtept up in his Chaire, and commanded Mr. MASTERSON, in the name of the Houſe of Commons, to give
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:116227:16"/>
them again a narrative of what he yeſterday declared to them.</p>
               <p>So he very formally begun, and ſpoke as freely, as if he had learned his Leſſon without book; and truly, I could not but ſtand amazed at the mans impudence, that he durſt, with ſo much confidence, tell ſo many lies as he did: But giving not much regard unto his accuſation, to treaſure it up in my memory, being reſolved before hand, to take no cognizance of his verball impeachment, which in Law was nothing, I fixed my mind very ſeriouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Lord Jehovah, my old experienced refuge, ſtrength and ſupport, and was a wreſtling with him for the incomes of his own ſelf, that ſo I might ſpeak freely and boldly, in his might and power (if it were poſſible) to the amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and terrour of his enemies, amongſt thoſe that ſhould hear me; divers of whom, I was confident, would lye in wait to catch and intrap me.</p>
               <p>And now and then (the Houſe (in my apprehenſion) being very full, I caſt my eie about me to look upon the countenances of the Members, and to obſerve their behaviours, moſt commonly fixing my eie ſtedfaſtly upon the Speaker in the Chair: Who aſſoon as he perceived Mr <hi>Maſterſon</hi> had done, beckoned his hand unto me, as I conceived, to have me anſwer the Prieſt: but I ſtood ſtill, and took no notice of his beck; at laſt, he wiſhed me to ſay what I could anſwer for my ſelf unto it: whereupon pauſing a little, after a congey made unto him, I opened my mouth to this effect.</p>
               <p>Mr Speaker, I deſire, in the firſt place, to premiſe this, That I look upon, and own this honourable Houſe, in its conſtitution and power, as the beſt, legalleſt, and juſteſt intereſt, power and authority, that is eſtabliſhed in this Kingdom; or that all the Commons of England viſibly hath, for the preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their lives, liberties and eſtates: And I doubt not, but ſo to ſpeak unto you, and ſo to behave my ſelf before you, this preſent day, as thereby to demonſtrate to you, that I am an honourer; an owner, and a prizer of this greateſt Engliſh authority and intereſt; in which, as a free Commoner of England, I have a little ſhare: And therfore, if this honourable Houſe pleaſe to afford me Paulis PRIVILEDGE, that he enjoyed amongſt the Heathen and Pagan, Roman Governours, or Magiſtrates; which was, to hear him ſpeak freely for himſelf, before they would condemn him: Which li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and priviledge, I freely and largely enjoyed, at the hands of the Cava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier Judges at Oxford, when I was arraigned in irons, before the Lord chief Juſtice <hi>Heath,</hi> and Sir <hi>Thomas Gardiner,</hi> late Recorder of London, for drawing my ſword, and at your comand, adventuring my life, for the great intereſt of the Kingdom involved, and ſingle repreſented in this honourable Houſe, in the deſtruction of which it periſheth; who before all the City and Country, then aſſembled in Guild-hall in Oxford, gave me free liberty, without the leaſt interruption, to ſay what I pleaſed, and to plead for my life, in the beſt manner that all thoſe abilities God had given me, would inable me<note n="*" place="margin">The enjoyment of which, was but my right by Law, as appears remarkably in the third part of <hi>Cooks</hi> Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, fol. 29. 137. 230.</note> to do.

               <p>And I ſhall the rather, at preſent, lay aſide the punctilios of my liberty, which is, not to anſwer to any Interrogatories, or confeſſe any thing againſt my ſelf, till it be legally, fully and punctually proved, becauſe I have longed for ſuch an opportunity as this; and my ſilence at this time, might, in the prejudiced opinions of ſome among you, againſt me, argue in their ſpirits, my guiltineſſe of all the lyes layed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

my charge; and thereby might, in their own hearts, take me, <hi>pro confeſſo,</hi> and conclude me guilty from my ſilence, but without a grant of free liberty from this Houſe, to ſpeak my mind freely, without any interruption: I ſhall not ſay one word more, but remain in perfect ſilence: So the Speaker commanded us to withdraw, which we did.</p>
               <p>And after about a quarter of an houres time, the Sergeant at Arms came, with his Mace, and uſhered us in again; and having placed our ſelves at the Bar, Mr Speaker having a paper in his hand, looked upon it, and ſaid to this effect, Mr <hi>Maſterſon,</hi> the Houſe conceives, that you have nothing nigh given them ſo full a relation of this buſineſſe to day, to Mr <hi>Lilburns</hi> face, as you did yeſterday, when you were ſingle: therfore I am commanded to aſk you what you ſay, to ſuch a thing, and ſuch a thing? and mentioned, as I remember, about ſome ſix or ſeven particulars: The ſubſtance of all of his accuſation, ſo near as that little heed I gave unto it, would enable me to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, was to this effect:</p>
               <p>That there was a deſign (eſpecially by me declared at the foreſaid mee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting) contrived by me, Sir, to deſtroy, or cut off, both Houſes of Parliament; and that we could not be far from the intention of executing it, in regard I had appoynted blew Ribbons to be worn in the hats of all thoſe that ſhould be ſaved alive: And that though we did now drive on a Petition to the Houſe, yet it was no more but a cloak, or a colour to raiſe the people by, that ſo we might the more covertly make our ſelves ſtrong enough to deſtroy them.</p>
               <p>But after he had done, the Speaker told me, the Houſe had given me free liberty to ſay what I pleaſed: at which I made a congey to him, and mighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly raiſed up my heart to God, with an earneſt inward cry to Heaven, now to come in, if ever, with power, ſtrength, wiſdom, reſolution and utterance; and praiſed be his name, he heard my inward ſighs and cries unto him; and put, as it were, a new heat, and burning fire, into all my veins, and raiſed up my ſpirit high, beyond its ordinary temper; and, with a little pauſe I begun, and ſaid after this manner, with a ſoft voyce.</p>
               <p>Mr Speaker, I take it for no ſmall honour, to be admitted this day, to this great (though juſt) priviledge, to have free liberty to ſpeak my mind freely, and boldly, without interruption; and having again premiſed what is before premiſed, and proteſted again what is before proteſted, with a loud and mighty voyce (though with an eaſy and ſenſible command over my ſelf) I went punctually on (without the leaſt interruption extemporary) and ſaid,</p>
               <p>Mr Speaker, I do here freely and voluntarily confeſſe it, that I had a hand, or a finger, in drawing the great Petition, with large<note n="*" place="margin">Which at the laſt end hereof, is printed at large.</note> Marginall notes fixed to it; and that I alſo had a hand in putting it to the preſſe, and paying for it: And truly, Mr Speaker, the ground of drawing of it, in my made ſtanding was this, we have many

years been fighting for our liberties and freedoms, and yet the generality of the Kingdom are as far to ſeek what they are, and where to find them, as ever; and the oppreſſions, and burthens, are very great and heavy upon the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as by tyths, taxes, exciſe, and free quarter, &amp;c. and that which is worſt of all, all trading, in a manner, is dead<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And truly Mr Speaker, I my ſelf look upon that Petition with ſuch admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration and ſatisfaction of ſpirit, and of ſo tranſcendent concernment to all honeſt and juſt men in my native Country; that I count it one of the moſt glorious morall actions to promote that Petition, that ever God counted me worthy in all my life to have a finger in: And Sir, let me freely tell you: I count it my glory and honour amongſt the ſons of men, that I have had ſo great a hand in forwarding of that Petition as a had: And therfore Sir as my crown and glory I ſhall freely tell you, that as ſoon as I and ſome other of my true and faithfull Comrades had cauſed ſome thouſands of that Petition to be printed; I did the beſt I could to ſet up conſtant meetings in ſeverall places in Southwark to promote the Petition: to which meetings all ſcruplers and objecters againſt any thing contained in the Petition, might repair unto for ſatisfaction: and I did conſtantly make one at all ſuch meetings, to improve and put forth my abilities, to open and unfold the excellency of that Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to anſwer all objections againſt any particular in it: and when there was appointed Truſtees in every pariſh (which only did conſiſt of ſuch as

               <p>I alſo went to <hi>Darfort</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and there was one of thoſe that ſet my hand to a Letter, ſubſcribed to all the — in the County of <hi>Kent;</hi> and alſo I ſet my hand to a Letter to Colonel <hi>Blunt,</hi> the Copy of both which, at the command of this Houſe, I ſhal be ready to preſent unto you at this Bar; and at my comming home, I ſet my hand to a Letter to Captaine <hi>Boine</hi> in <hi>Kent,</hi> and did beſides, the beſt I could to promote the foreſaid Petition, not only in <hi>London,</hi> but in ſeveral other<note n="*" place="margin">Yea, and I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in a moneths longer time, if <hi>Cromwell</hi> and his agents in the Houſe had not hindred us, as they did, we had got above a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand hands to it; the promoting and proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting of which, would in all likelyhood have hindred the Wars that followed, the innocent bloud ſhed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, lying principally upon <hi>Cromwels</hi> ſcore for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant hindering the ſetling the liberties of the Nation, and proſecuting to death and bonds, the proſecutors thereof, which bread divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and they the Wars.</note> Counties be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, and hearing as before is declared in my foreſaid diſcourſe at the Houſe of Commons door (the ſubſtance of which I againe related at their Bar) that ſome honeſt people, in or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Wappin,</hi> ſcrupulled to Petition any more to the Houſe, for the reaſons before mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in <hi>p.</hi> 16. 17.

deſired by ſome friends to come to the meeting, to help to anſwer their objections; I did accordingly, and being at the foreſaid place, there were diverſe friends met, and the diſcourſe was begun; <hi>in which, with many arguments it was declared, that it was our duty to go on with Petitioning to this Houſe againe, for that it was all the viſible juſt power, that was left in the Kingdome, to preſerve the peace thereof,</hi> and though all members thereof did not act as they ſhould, yet to do any thing that ſhould deſtroy the power of the whole, it would be a deſtruction to our ſelves and the Kingdome, for the people being in that <hi>mutinous temper,</hi> by reaſon of their oppeſſions, and burthens, there was no way to keep them in peace and quietneſſe, <hi>but by a vigorous propoſing and proſecuting of ſome univerſal juſt things to eaſe them, and for the future to ſecure them; neither was there any ſafe or ſure way for the people to act in, to make their grievances known and probably hope for redreſſe, but by Pettiion, and that to the Houſe of Commons, which was the moſt our owne intereſt of any power in England;</hi> and no man knew at this nick of time, what juſt and righteous things might be produced by and from the Houſe, if they ſhould ſee the people univerſally own, &amp; cloſe with ſo juſt and <hi>gallant a thing as this Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is, and much more to the ſame purpoſe, which I cannot well remember: but</hi> this I am ſure of, that there was not in the whole diſcourſe, one diſ-ingaging expreſſion to the intereſt of this Houſe, but I dare with much confidence aver it, that the <hi>whole ſtreame, ſcope and bent of the whole diſcourſe, was to lift up and preſerve the intereſt of this Houſe,</hi> that ſo it might be the better inabled to do juſt and righteous things for the whole Kingdome, according to the end of the truſt they have repoſed in you; and I dare ſafely aver it, there was not ſo much as one bit of a miſchievous or factious diſcourſe at all; the whole tendency of it being to peace, Juſtice and Union.</p>
               <p>And by-and-by there was an objection raiſed, as I remember, to this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: <hi>I, but if the generality of the people would joyne in the Petition, and act to ſave themſelves, with vigour and ſtrength, there might then be ſome encouragement for us once againe to joyne in acting with them, but for any thing could be perceived, the generality of the people were as willing to be ſlaves, as any were to have them ſo; and having been ſo often jaded, had ſet down with a kind of a reſolution to ſtir no more come what would come;</hi> therefore we being but a ſmall number to the whole, our ſtriving in this caſe, was but to ſow the wind.</p>
               <p>Unto which Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi> it was anſwered, much to this effect, That the great end wherefore God ſent man into the world was, that he ſhould do good in his generation, and thereby glorifie God in his generation; and it is ſaid of Chriſt, <hi>that he made it his worke, to go up and down to do good unto all, that he could meet with;</hi> and therein he was declared to be like unto his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the immitating of which he had required of al of us, <hi>that ſhould do good to all men,</hi> and how did we imitate him in this; if our friends, our Country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, our brethren, were ready to periſh, and in their ſottiſhneſſe were ready
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:116227:19"/>
to be deſtroyed; <hi>and God had opened our eyes to ſee it, and yet we would not do the beſt we could to ſave and preſerve them,</hi> though they were unwilling to ſave and preſerve themſelves.</p>
               <p>Nay, Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi> it was there further preſſed, that to ſit ſtil in ſuch a univerſall periſhing caſe as this is, was ſo far below a Chriſtian, that it was beneath and below the very light of nature and ſelfe-preſervation, that was evinced after this manner, as I am an individual, I am a part of the whole Nation, and if it periſh in the eye of reaſon, I and mine muſt periſh with it; But the whole Nation is in danger of an univerſal de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, by oppreſſion, injuſtice, and decay of Trade, which would ſpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bring famine, and that would bring all manner of confuſion, by the poor peoples riſing up to cut the throats of the rich-men, to get their eſtates and monies to buy them bread, and to preſerve nature, and in this horrible con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, we ſhould be a prey to every forraigne enemy that would firſt invade us; and if ſuch a thing ſhould happen, we muſt become an <hi>Aceldoma, a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, a wilderneſſe, a field of bloud:</hi> And I clearly ſee all this before my eies, and yet I wil ſit ſtil and do nothing towards the publique ſafety (in which I am tranſcendently concerned and involved) becauſe the far greater part of my neighbours ſit down in ſilence, and are like ſots reſolved (or ready) to periſh in their ſottiſhneſſes, and I muſt periſh with them: <hi>am I not guilty of mine owne ruine and deſtruction,</hi> if when I ſee it before me, and ſottiſhly ſit downe, and uſe not my uttermoſt indeavours to preſerve the whole (in the preſervation of which, I am preſerved) becauſe the reſt of my neighbours and friends wil not joyne with me to do it?</p>
               <p>Nay, Mr. <hi>Speaker,</hi> it was further preſſed, that in ſuch a caſe as this is (<hi>which is now the caſe of the Kingdome</hi>) I am bound and tied in conſcience and duty to my ſelfe, with vigour and ſtrength to act, although my neigbour refuſeth ſalvation, or preſervation by me, and commands me not to ſave him. And it was further illuſtrated in this manner; <hi>my neighbours Houſe is on fire, and I clearly ſee, if it be not quenched, mine is likely to be burned by it,</hi> whereupon I go to my neighbour, and proffer him my helpe to quench it, and he being, it may be in a fright, a fullenneſſe, a ſottiſhneſſe, a maſe, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper, or a revengefull maliciouſneſſe refuſeth my help, yea, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands me not to helpe him, but threatens me if I doe; yet notwithſtanding all this, I am bound in duty to ſelfe, and univerſall preſervation to help to do it whether he wil or no, yea, &amp; to pull down his houſe to help to quench the fire, to keep my owne and my neighbours from being burnt, whereas if none of this were, but that his houſe were ſtanding, and in no ſuch dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, for me then againſt his wil and mind, to ſet my foot over his threſhold, I am a tranſgreſſor, and an incroacher upon my nighbours rights and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties. In the ſecond place, Mr Speaker, it was anſwered, That in caſe my neighbour were a drowning of himſelf, and I ſee it, I were bound by the Law of God and Nature, whether he would or no, to ſave him; nay, but much more, if in his drowning, I were likely to be drowned with him, were I bound to ſave him (if I can) although he laid a thouſand commands upon me to the contrary.</p>
               <p>And hereabouts, as I remember, it was further objected; That the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:116227:19"/>
all over the Kingdom were generally very ignorant, and malignant, and hated the Parliament and us, whom they called Roundheads, Independents, &amp;c. for our cordiall adhering to them, under whom they groan under greater oppreſſions and burthens, then before the Parliament; and for all their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences and fightings, were never a bit the freer, either at preſent, or in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture grounded hopes; and therfore for us (that were for the foreſaid reaſon ſo faithfull to the generality of the people) to act in this petition, they would but contemn it for our ſakes, and be provoked to riſe up againſt us.</p>
               <p>Unto which, Mr Speaker, my ſelf, &amp;c. anſwered to this effect; The peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally malignant, and more for the King then the Parliament<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but what's the reaſon? but becauſe their burthens are greater now then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and are likely to continue without any redreſſe, or any viſible, valuable conſideration holden out unto them, for all the bloud and treaſure they had ſpent for their liberties and freedoms; and the reaſon why they were ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, and did ſo little inquire after their liberties and freedom, was, Mr Spea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, becauſe, that though the Parliament had declared in generall, that they engaged to fight for their liberties, yet they never particularly told them what they were, nor never diſtinctly held forth the glory and ſplendour of them, to make them in love with them, and to ſtudy how to preſerve them: and for want of a clear declaring what was the particulars of the Kings Rights, and the nature of his office; and what was the Parliaments particular priviledges, power and duty to the people of the Kingdom, that chuſed and truſted them; and what particularly was the peoples rights and freedoms; they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by left in blindneſſe and ignorance, and by reaſon of their oppreſſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they knew no better, doted implicitly upon the King, as the fountain of peace, juſtice, and righteouſneſſe; without whom, nothing that was good could have a being in this Kingdom: So I told them, Mr Speaker, it was no marvail, that the poor people in this particular, were in FOGS, MISTS, WILDERNESSES AND DARKNESSE; conſidering, that this Houſe, in their Declarations, had ſo plaid at faſt and looſe with them: for though, Mr Speaker, this Houſe voted to this effect, That the King, ſeduced by evil councel, had made War againſt the Parliament and people, and that they are traitors that aſſiſted<note n="*" place="margin">1 part, Book, Decl. pag. 259, 260, 508, 509, 576, 722, 914.</note> him: And fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther declared, That he had ſet up his Standard againſt the Parliament and people, and hereby put the whole Kingdom out of his protection, contrary to the truſt repoſed in him, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his oath, diſſolving Government thereby; and that he, in his own perſon, marched up in the head of an Army, by force of Arms, to deſtroy the Parliament, and in them, the whole King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, their Laws and<note n="‖" place="margin">1 part, Book, Decl. pag. 580, 584, 587, 617, 639, 690.</note> Liberties.</p>
               <p>And yet, Mr Speaker, with the ſame breath declared, The King is the fountain of juſtice, and that he can do no<note n="†" place="margin">1 part, pag. 199, 304.</note> wrong; and forc'd the people to take Oaths and Covenants, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his perſon: and yet, at the ſame time, gave the Earl of Eſſex, and all thoſe under him, Commiſſion, To fight with, kill and ſlay all that oppoſed
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:116227:20"/>
them; and declared, the King, in his own period, marched in the head of an Army, to oppoſe and deſtroy them; and yet gave them a Commiſſion, to fight for King and Parliament: So that, Mr Speaker, here is riddle upon riddle, and myſterie upon myſterie; which doth even confound and amaze the people, and put them into Woods and Wilderneſſes, that they could not ſee or know where they are, or what to think of themſelves, or of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or of the King: only this they very well know, that their burthens are greater now, then ever they were before; and that they have been made fools, in pretendingly fighting for liberty, which hath brought them into bondage: And that though it was formerly declared, the King had no Nega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive voyce, or Legiſlative power, but is bound by his Oath to paſſe all ſuch Laws, as the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, folk or Commons, ſhall<note n="*" place="margin">1 part, Book, Decl. pag. 205, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>putably and inſeparably inherent in him; and as though now their conſciences told them, they muſt crave pardon of him for all the actions they have done without him, and againſt him: O riddles! and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathomable myſteries! ſufficiently able to make the people deſirous to be ignorant of their liberties and freedoms, and never to hear of them more; eſpecially, conſidering they have paid ſo dear, pretendedly, for the injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, and yet after five years fighting for them, know not where to find one of them.</p>
               <p>But, Mr Speaker, they were told, that in this petition the people had clearly held out unto them, and that upon the undeniable principles of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and juſtice, the Kings Rights, the Parliaments, and their own; and that the two former were, and of right alwaies ought to be ſubſervient to the good of the latter: and they were told, it was not ſo much perſons, as things, that they doted upon; and therfore undoubtedly thoſe that ſhould really hold out juſtice and righteouſneſſe unto the people, was thoſe that they would be in love with; and therfore in mercy to our ſelves, and in love and compaſſion to our native Country, it was preſſed, that every man that deſired to fulfill his end in coming into the World, and to be like unto his Maſter, in doing good, ſhould vigorouſly promote and further this juſt and gallant Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition, as the principall means to procure ſafety, peace, juſtice and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the Land of our Nativity, and knit the hearts and ſpirits of our divided Country-men in love again each unto other and in love unto us, which they could not chuſe but afford, when they ſhould viſibly ſee, we endeavoured their good as well and as much as our own, there being all the principall foundations of freedom and juſtice, that our hearts could deſire, or long after, in this very petition: And if our greateſt end were not accompliſhed, in our proſecuting of this petition, <hi>viz.</hi> the Parliaments eſtabliſhing the things therein deſired: yet the promoting of it would beget underſtanding and knowledge in the people, when they ſhould hear it, and read it, and diſcourſe upon it; and if nothing but that were effected, our labour would not be to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally loſt; for nothing did more inſtate Tyrants in the ſecure promotion of
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:116227:20"/>
tyrannie, then ignorance and blindneſſe in the people: And therfore for the begetting of knowledge, it was requiſite it ſhould be promoted; as alſo, for healing of the diviſions amongſt the people, and knitting them together in love, that ſo their minds might be diverted from ſtudying the deſtruction each of other, to ſtudy the deſtruction of Tyrants, that would in time deſtroy them all.</p>
               <p>And, Mr Speaker, there was one in the company, that made a motion, to this effect, That he did conceive it was more requiſite, at preſent, ſpeedily to ſecond the Armies Declaration, with a petition to encourage this Houſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorouſly to go on, to proſecute their late gallant Votes of Non-Addreſſes (for ſo they were called) to which was anſwered,</p>
               <p>That in this petition was contained more then was in all all their Votes, for it ſtruck at the very root of all that Tyrannie that had enſlaved, and would enſlave us, <hi>viz.</hi> the Negative voyce in King and Lords, both which the Votes did not; and it was impoſſible, that there could be an active Member in the Houſe of Commons, but knew that this petition was promoting all over the Kingdom; which did abundantly declare greater encouragement to all thoſe Members of the Houſe, that really intended good unto the Commonwealth, then poſſible could be in a ſingle complementall petition, ſigned with 4 or 5000 hands; ſuch a petition being rather fit to puff them up, then upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all grounds to ſtrengthen and encourage them fully to mind the peoples good; and there was never a Member of the Houſe, whoſe deſign, in the largeſt extent, was no more then the pulling down of the King, that ſo he might be a King himſelf: but of neceſſitie he muſt receive more ſatisfaction and encouragement from the knowledge of the promoting this gallant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd petition (which is a clear demonſtration to the Parliament, that thoſe that promote it, clearly underſtand, that the King and the Lords Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, and their liberties, are inconſiſtent) then he could do from a bare complementary petition; which would alſo be dangerous to our ſelves, in quaſhing the vigorous proſecuting of this, that contained the ultimate of our deſires, and the ſum of all thoſe things, that in this World we deſired, to make us happy.</p>
               <p>But, Mr Speaker, it was again objected, That ſeeing this petition ſtruck ſo much at the Houſe of Lords, as it did, who lately it was ſaid, had concurred with this Houſe in their gallant Votes againſt the King, it was dangerous to the Kingdoms ſafety, in this juncture of time to promote it, leſt it might occaſion a claſhing betwixt the two Houſes, which would now be very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous.</p>
               <p>Unto which, Mr Speaker, my ſelf, &amp;c. anſwered to this effect, That if the Lords had ſo concurred in theſe Votes, that they had declared it had been their duty, without diſpute, to have concurred to all ſuch Votes as the Houſe of Commons had paſſed, there had been ſome ground to have pleaded for a reſpect unto them from us: But ſeeing they ſo paſſed the Votes, as in the paſſing of them, they declare it to be their right, to give their deniall to any Votes the Houſe of Commons ſhall hereafter paſſe, that doth not pleaſe them: we are thereby engaged the rather to go on with our petition, to pluck up
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:116227:21"/>
this their deſtructive intereſt by the roots for future, that had brought all our<note n="*" place="margin">See 1 part Book Decl. pag. 289, 364, 365, 398, 522, 526, 528, 548, 557.</note> miſeries and woes upon us.</p>
               <p>For, Mr Speaker, if the Lords be conſidered in their Judicative power, we ſhall find them as guilty of treaſon, in ſubverting our fundamentall Laws and Liberties, as ever the Lord of Strafford was: who in his impeachment of high Treaſon by this Houſe, was accuſed in the 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. articles, that he had traiterouſly ſubverted the fundamentall Laws of England and Ireland, and introduced an arbitrary tyrannicall Government beyond and above Law, in that he had upon papers,<note n="†" place="margin">And if theſe very things ſhould now be judged trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as they are and were in the Earl of Stafford, I wonder what ſhould becom of all our preſent Junto at Weſtminſter, and their new thing, called, A Councel of State; undoubtedly the moſt (if not all) of them, muſt go to Tyburn, or Tower-hill, there by an hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or axe to receive their juſt deſerts, Amen.</note> pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and verball complaints, without any due courſe, proceſſe or ſhadow of Law (but meerly by the law of his own will) outed divers of the Free-men thereof out of their liberties, properties and free holds, to the ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of many of their families.</p>
               <p>And truly Mr Speaker, <hi>I</hi> muſt aver it, and do aver it before this honourable Houſe, that the Houſe of Lords are as guilty of this trai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous ſubverting of our fundamentall Laws and Liberties, and introducing and exerciſing an arbitrary tyrannicall Government, above and beyond all Law and Juſtice, as he was; and by the law of their own wils, without any due courſe or proceſſe of Law, have outed divers Free-men of England out of their liberties, properties and free-holds; they themſelves being complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, proſecutors, parties, witneſſes, Jury and Judges, have paſſed moſt bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous and tyrannical cenſures upon them, to the apparent ruin of them and their families: Yea, and upon me have paſſed ſo barbarous and tranſcendent an illegal ſentence, that I am confident the like of it in all circumſtances is not to be parallel'd in all the Earl of Straffords tyrannie. And Mr Speaker, let me freely tell you, that unleſſe this Houſe do execute upon the preſent tyrannicall Houſe of Lords, or the miſchievous law and libertie deſtroying Ring-leaders amongſt them, the Earl of Straffords puniſhment, for what they have already done, and for future take care to prevent their or any others ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of the like arbitrary and tyrannicall power again, I ſhall never juſtifie you for righteous and impartiall Judges, or think that you have diſcharged your duty either to God or the Commonwealth, who choſe and truſted you to preſerve their liberties and freedoms, and puniſh thoſe that deſtroy them.</p>

ſole and only true end encloſing with him; and therfore were now ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitated, for the obtaining the declared ultimate of their deſires, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſetting up themſelves, to pull down him: And if in there Votes they had intended reall good unto the generality of the people, they would have with them, inſtated them in the poſſeſſion of ſome juſt and gallant freedoms and priviledges, worth their engaging again with and for the Parliament, in a new War; and ſo to have made them in love with the Houſe, for their juſtice and goodneſſe, handed out unto them; that their lives, nor eſtates, might not have been dear to them, but with willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe they might have freely adventured all they had, in oppoſing thoſe that oppoſed them.</p>
               <p>Whereas now with theſe Votes, they had nothing that was of generall good holden out unto them, but the likely hood of a new War, in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voking afreſh, to the higheſt, all the Kings party, the Scotch, and the Zealots amongſt the Preſbyters; yea, and ſo paſſing their Votes, that in themſelves rightly conſidered, they ſignified nothing; for if the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament fac'd back again, and un-voted them the next Week, as it is poſſible they might, theſe Votes were but a ſnare, to hazard the future deſtruction of thoſe men, that at preſent ſhould rejoyce at them, and in them: And, Mr Speaker, they were deſired to conſider, that if we implicitly, and hand over head, without firſt groundedly knowing what ſhould be the prize of all our hazards and bloud, ſhould again engage againſt the King, and alſo againſt the Scots (who had declared ſo much enmity, as to root up by the roots, all that would not concur to their every thing and nothing Preſbyterie, under the names of Heretiques and Sectaries) who were now likely, upon the Kings intereſt, to invade the Kingdom: what ſhould we get by it? It's true, we might be the occaſion of ſhedding much bloud, but in the concluſion it was poſſible our own might be ſhed: But ſuppoſe we were Conquerours, and the Army by our means did overcome the Scots: what better were we then? nay, were we not worſe then, then now we are? and more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be made ſlaves, then now we are? For ſeeing the Grandees in the Army and Parliament, have declared ſo much bitterneſſe and enmity of ſpirit againſt all thoſe principles of righteouſneſſe and juſtice, that we have promoted and propoſed; without the firm eſtabliſhment of which, it is impoſſible for us ever to be any other then vaſſals; and thoſe that rule over us, perfect Tyrants: and if implicitly we ſhould help them to ſubdue the Scots, we ſhould but thereby the more eaſily enable them to make the more perfect ſlaves of us, when we had: whom we might eaſily ſee (by their malicious and bloudy proſecuting of our late Friends in the Army) did not anew begin to court us, out of any love to us, or out of any free diſpoſition to do us or the Kingdoms good, but meerly becauſe they had need of us, and did not well know how to go through their work, at preſent, <note n="*" place="margin">Which I have undeniably proved, in my late Book, of the 8 June, 1649. pag. 34, 35, 36, 37, 38. to be their only deſign in all their cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of us in the day of their diſtreſſe, and that there is no more truth in the promiſes, and engagements they then made, then in the Devils; who I will never hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter believe, in whatſoever they ſay, or ſwear.</note> without us.</p>

                  <pb n="36" facs="tcp:116227:25"/>For truly, Mr Speaker, as I told my Friends, I was afraid that the intereſt of the generality of the Officers, in the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, but eſpecially the Grandees, was not peace, righteouſneſſe, juſtice and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, but wars, fightings and<note n="†" place="margin">Which is fully witneſſed for a truth, by Major <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tington (Cromwels</hi> quondam darling) in the 11 page of his foreſaid charge; where he declares <hi>Cromwels</hi> great rejoycing after his firſt brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Parliament, and getting the remaining part to own the Army, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle pay upon them: Now, ſaith <hi>Cromwel,</hi> we may, for ought I know, be an Army ſo long as we live; and that he was as able to govern the Kingdom, as either <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> or <hi>Hollis,</hi> &amp;c. which he declares to be the principall thing, in all his conteſts with the Parliament, he ſought after.</note> catchings; and without the continuance of which. I conceived they could not continue their pride and tyrannicall domination over their Souldiers, and the reſt of the people of the Kingdom (and abſolutely I conceive their intereſt to be war) But it was our intereſt, and the generality of the people of the Kingdom, to prevent wars, if it were poſſible. But if we muſt engage in war again, it was our intereſt and wiſdom, ſo to engage, if it were poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, as that meerly as Engliſh men, we might be unanimous in our engagements, either againſt the Scots, or any other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts whatſoever, that would rob us of our Engliſh liberties and freedoms: And, Mr Speaker, I told them both theſe things were contained in the Petition: For Firſt, if thoſe things were granted unto us, that were deſired in the Petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it was impoſſible for us to conceive of any thing elſe: the want of which, is worth the going to war for: And if the Petition were vigorouſly promoted, and purſued to the Houſe, without all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy it hath ſuch excellent things in it, ſo good in themſelves; for all ſorts and kinds of Engliſh men, that if the Houſe and the people ſhould be united in thoſe gallant, juſt and rationall things, the generall heart-burnings of the Kingdom would be alaied; and confidence in love and reſpect to each other, would be raiſed up amongſt us; and our union of hearts thereby each to other, as Engliſhmen, would be as a wall of braſſe, for ſecuring the common intereſt of our Nation: So that neither Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, nor any forraign power in Europe, durſt to invade us: ſo that in the vigorous proſecuting of this Petition, union and love would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and war prevented thereby: whereas nothing in the world will occaſion wars ſo much, as our diſ-union and heart-burnings each at other: which is impoſſible ever to be alaied, but either by the active proſecuting of this Petition, or ſomething like it; that ſo
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:116227:25"/>
ſomething that is good for all men, as Engliſh-men, might be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led:</p>
               <p>But in the ſecond place, if we could not be ſo speedy in the proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Petition, ſo as to get thoſe univerſall good and juſt things, therein contained, ſetled, before the <hi>Scots</hi> begun to Invade us; yet if upon their march we ſhould enjoy the poſſeſſion of them, <hi>it would make the generality of Engliſh-men ſtand together as one man;</hi> and all of them in the ſpirit, and with the principles of Engliſh-men, oppoſe them: ſo that the War (if it muſt be) would be carried on with that vigor and ſtrength, that it were impoſſible, <hi>for all the power in Scotland, if they did the worſt they could to deſtroy our Nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Whereas now in our divided condition, they will be ſure if they come in, to make a prey of us; for in their comming in, <hi>they declare for the King's Intereſt;</hi> which abſolutely unites and knits their owne Kingdom as one man againſt us; and glues unto them in <hi>England,</hi> all <hi>the Kings party,</hi> and of neceſſity <hi>the Presbyters muſt joyne with their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Covenant;</hi> and riſings there will be of neceſſity, and without all peradventure, all over the Kingdome: and if the Army be united within themſelves <hi>(as it is a very great queſtion whether they be or no)</hi> and were able to deale and grabble with all that oppoſition it is like to meet with, from thoſe ſeverall parties and intereſts, that here are like to riſe up againſt it; yet truely Mr <hi>Speaker,</hi> though I do not like the late apoſtatized actions of the great men in the Army, I do as little like the <hi>Scotch</hi> high flown expreſſions, to inſtate the King abſolutely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Militia as His right, and His abſolute Negative Voice: And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed Mr Speaker, it ſounds not wel nor juſtly in my eares, for the Scots, who are and will be free men at home, and will neither (as I am told) allow the King the exerciſe of the Militia in their Kingdome, nor His Negative Voice, no nor yet the benefit of His Revenue; that they ſhould notwithſtanding all this, go about to make us all ſlaves, by fettering us with His miſchievous Negative Voice, and His abſolute exerciſe of our Militia, which ſeemes to me to be nothing leſſe, then a deſire to pick a quarrell with us, that ſo, Mr Speaker, they might come in againe for ſome more of our guids; therefore Mr Speaker, I cry out for union and peace upon juſt principles: For the very beginnings of War againe amongſt us, would preſently deſtroy that little Trade that is left, and then undoubtedly comes in famine, which is already at our very doores; for Mr Speaker, they were told a ſtory to this effect, That ſome <hi>Wilke-ſhire</hi> Cloathiers, comming to the <hi>Sarazens head</hi> in <hi>Friday-ſtreet,</hi> had for a truth reported to the Maſter of the houſe, that Trading was already ſo decayed in their Country, that that Cloathier that uſed to ſet an hundred poor people at worke, could now ſcarce ſet twelve; inſomuch, that the poor peoples neceſſities were growne ſo great in that Country, that they already begin in companies of ſix, ten,

               <p>And truely Mr Speaker, things are like ſhortly to be as bad at Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, for want of Trade; for I have heard ſuch grievous complaints from two ſorts of people eſpecially, that it would pitty any mans heart (that hath the heart of a man) to hear of the wants and neceſſities of divers families amongſt them, that formerly had lived in good faſhion; and they are the <hi>Weavers</hi> &amp; <hi>Cloathworkers;</hi> and as for the <hi>Weavers,</hi> their Trade conſiſting principally in Ribbons and Laces; but ſuperfluities in ſuch things being laid aſide, their Trade was growne exceeding dead, and many hundreds of their families falne into great miſeries and wants, by reaſon that the moſt part of that little remaining part of their Trade that is left them, is taken from them by <hi>French men, Walloons, &amp;c.</hi> and that which adds unto their miſery, Mr Speaker, is this; That the Lord Major and Court of Aldermen, do put in execution of late A MOST WICKED, ILLEGAL Order, or Ordinance, of their owne making, by reaſon of which, their Catchpoles, ſeize upon the goods of the ſaid poor Free-men of London, and beat and wound them, yea, and have committed murder upon ſome of them, if they come to any Innes, &amp;c. and offer to ſell their goods to any but Shop-keepers, who will give them but what they pleaſe for them; ſo that the poor <hi>Weavers,</hi> though Free-men of <hi>London,</hi> are not only in miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable poverty, but in the miſerableſt ſlavery (in the City where they by name are Free-men) that it is poſſible for men to be in, and to bear it with patience.</p>
               <p>And Mr Speaker, the poor <hi>Cloathworkers,</hi> who by the expreſſe Statute-Law of the Kingdom, ought to dreſſe one white cloath in ever tenne, <note n="*" place="margin">The Statute of <hi>8</hi> Eliz. Chap. <hi>6.</hi>
                  </note> that the Merchant, Patentee Monopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lizers, commonly called the Merchant Adventurers, ſends into the Low-Countries, and Denmarke; but now by reaſon that the chiefeſt of that Law, Liberty and Trade-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Monopoly, are Commiſſioners of the Cuſtome-Houſe, which in juſtice, equity and reaſon, no Trading Merchants whatever, never ought to be, they are deprived of their right in that particular, and cruſh'd in pieces with potency, and great purſes; whereas, in the time of ſo exceeding great decay of Trade, it were more juſt and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enable them to dreſſe the other nine, to ſet their poor fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies at work, many of which are ready to ſtarve, then to take one piece of the tenth Cloath from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:116227:26"/>Mr. Speaker, All theſe things, with many more that then were mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>repreſented the miſeries of this Kingdom very ſad and great,</hi> and made the preſent Speaker there conclude, That if War did come amongſt us, of neceſſity Famine would follow, <hi>and that would occaſion all the poor people all over England to riſe confuſedly in hurly burly, and to cut the throats of their rich neighbours, to get their riches to buy them bread to keep them alive:</hi> and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no they might not as ſoon fall upon us, that they looked upon as Round-heads, Independent, Sectaries, &amp;c. and ſo deſtroy us for our cordial and faithful adherence to the Parliament, whom <hi>now the moſt of them looked upon as thoſe that had brought all their evils and miſeries upon them.</hi> From all which conſiderations, it was (Mr. Speaker) with earneſtneſſe preſſed vigorouſly to promote this Petition all over the Kingdom, <hi>as the onely means to heal and cure all our diſeaſes and maladies,</hi> the things therein contained being ſo juſt in themſelves, that none but thoſe that deſired to be <hi>abſolute Tyrants,</hi> could ſpeak againſt them: the obtaining of which would ſettle peace and quietneſſe amongſt us, and ſo cauſe Trade again to flouriſh. And Mr. Speaker, to preſſe this nail home to the head, I do confeſſe that I further added, that if ſuch a generall confuſion (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is ſpoken of) ſhould ariſe, it would then (I was confident of it) be greater ſecurity from the rage of the rude multitude, to be known to be
<q>a vigorous proſecutor of this gallant, juſt and righteous <hi>Petition,</hi> (that did as much concern their good as our own) then to <hi>wear a blue Ribbon in our hats.</hi> And truly, Mr. Speaker, I may now with my pen add this, That blue Ribbons being Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his Colours, who now with his Army are the grand and ſtrong protection of all thoſe that march under his Colours, under which whoſoever ſhall come, may probably think to have ſafety; yet I was of opinion, and ſtill am, That publick knowledge of a vigorous and ſtrong acting in ſo tranſcendent, gallant and juſt a Petition as this is, in the day of a fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed univerſall ſtorm in <hi>England,</hi> will be of greater ſecurity and protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, then to be one of Sir <hi>Thomas Fairfax</hi> his Army, and to wear his Colours of blue Ribbons in his hat:</q>
for the Kingdom generally look upon the Souldiers now as their oppreſſors, and deſtroyers of their Laws, Liberties and Properties: but the promoters and procurers of the juſt things contained in this Petition, cannot chuſe but be looked on by them as the <hi>repairers of their breaches,</hi> and the reſtorers of their Laws and Liberties.</p>
               <p>Mr. Speaker, When we were coming away, there was one of the company ſaid, <hi>That he heard a rumour abroad, as if the Lords had offered me a large ſum of money ſo I would deſiſt from proſecuting this large Petition; he therefore deſired me to give him a true account, whether this report were true or no.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which I anſwered to this effect, That it was not true; but it was poſſible it might ariſe from the report of ſome Meſſages I lately had received from the Lord WHARTON: And Mr. Speaker, for that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, I told him to this effect, That not long ſince, there came a Gentleman of ſome quality (and a man I look upon as an ingenuous man) to my lodging in London, and told me before two other Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen (friends of mine) to this effect, <hi>That my Lord</hi> Wharton <hi>remembred</hi>
                  <pb n="42" facs="tcp:116227:27"/>
                  <q>his reſpect unto me, who (he told me, he was very confident) was my very good friend, and would willingly ſerve me (and that he did be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, cordially) in any thing that lay within his power; and who, as he told me, did very much conſider my long ſuffering condition, by reaſon of which he did beleeve money was not very plentifull with me, and therefore he was come from him to let me know, that he hath in readineſſe a very conſiderable token for me, which he would ſend me, if he thought it would not be ſcorned, but accepted in love and reſpect.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Unto which (after a little pauſe) I anſwered to this effect, That I deſired him to preſent my ſervice to his Lordſhip, and from mee to thank him for his civility and courteſie towards me; <hi>But f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>r me to receive his money, I could not in the leaſt do it: becauſe for me who profeſſed ingenuity, and abhorred ingratitude</hi> (as a moſt diſhonourable thing in any man what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever) <hi>to receive his money, it muſt needs to me become an obliging engagement, and tie me one way or another to ſtudie how to requite it,</hi> which truly I told him, to his Lordſhip, (as he was now a Patentee prerogative Lord, and exerciſed a Legiſlative and arbitrary power by vertue thereof, which I looked upon as altogether deſtructive to the very being of the Liberties and Freedoms of the Commons of <hi>England) I could not in the leaſt do it: but was abſolutely reſolved to profeſſe open War with his arbitrary Prerogative-Lordſhip as long as</hi> I <hi>had breath in my body,</hi> and never to be reconciled un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it: And therefore in ſhort, tell his Lordſhip from me, that if I were in ſuch great ſtraits, that I had not one penny in all the world (nor knew not where to borrow it) to buy me, my Wife, and Children bread to ſave us alive, and if in this great ſtrait, his Lordſhip as he now is, ſhould ſend me <hi>ten thouſand pounds in gold, I would ſcorn to accept, or let my fingers ſo much as touch one peece of it; or that any that belonged to me, with my conſent ſhould do it for me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I deſired him to tell his Lordſhip from me, that if he pleaſed to throw away his arbitrary, tyrannical pattentee, Lordly power, (which was, and would be the ruine of this Kingdome) and <hi>would put himſelf upon the affection of his Countrey,</hi> to be choſen a Knight of a Shire, as a well-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving Engliſhman, I ſhould then honour him, and be willing and ready to accept of the meaneſt token that he ſhould ſend me, though it were but Five ſhillings, and judg my ſelf obliged to ſerve him, and ſhould readily doe it, <hi>yea, in preſerving his reall propriety in his great eſtate unvio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably; yea, and the title of his Honour, hereditary to his poſterity for ever.</hi> And as I told my friend, Mr. Speaker, the Report might ariſe from this, which relation is true, and hath not been delivered to me once, nor twice, but oftner. But Mr. SPEAKER, I ſhall acquaint you further, that I in part acquainted my friend, how ingenuouſly I had dealt not only with my Lord WHARTON, but the whole Houſe of Peeres; in that I obeyed their firſt Warrant they ſent to me to come to their Barr, the 10th. June, 1646. and immediatly as ſoon as I was ſerved with it, being about ſix a clock on the next morning at my own houſe, (and I was to appear before them at Ten the ſame morning) <hi>I went immediately to my Lord</hi> Whartons <hi>houſe;</hi> and he being not ſtirring, I deſired his ſervant to tell his Lordſhip what had happened; and that in regard <hi>I was obliged to their
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:116227:27"/>
Houſe,</hi> for the late Juſtice they had done for me about my reparations againſt the Star-chamber Judges, BEING OLD SIR HENRY VANE, &amp;c. <hi>I was reſolved for ingenuity and gratitudes ſake, to vaile my Bonnet to them, as farre as with honeſty and a good conſcience I could;</hi> And therefore it was that I had obeyed their Warrant, and promiſed to appear at their Barre; which, as I ſent him word, was more then by Law I was bound unto: but yet when I came there, <hi>I was reſolved at their Bar, to proteſt againſt their juriſdiction over a Commoner;</hi> but I could doe no leſſe then acquaint his Lordſhip with it before-hand, that ſo if he pleaſed to ſave and preſerve the honour of their Houſe, he might; if not, I <hi>would doe it, if I dyed for it:</hi> And if his Lordſhip pleaſed, I would meet him at the ſtroke of Nine a clock at COL. FLEETWOODS in black Fryers, to talk with him further about it, where he appointed to meet me; and away went I, <hi>to a friend, and drew up my Proteſtation,</hi> leaving him one copy to print in caſe I were impriſoned, and I took another, with my hand and ſeal to it; and accordingly, Mr. Speaker, I met my <hi>Lord at Col. Fleetwoods houſe,</hi> who as I remember, was gone abroad, whereupon I walked with my Lord to the black-Fryers bridg, where <hi>we had a large diſcourſe about the Lords originall juriſdiction over Commoners;</hi> and I ſhewed him my proteſtation, <hi>the marrow of which he read;</hi> and I earneſtly intreated him that he would be pleaſed to ſpeak to the EARL OF ESSEX AND WARWICK, AND MY LORD ROBERTS, who was the principall man that had done all my bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſſe for me, and tell them from me, I bore ſo much honourable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect unto them, and their Houſe, that if they pleaſed to command me to wait upon them, I would; and upon all the reſt of the Lords in the houſe, <hi>and freely anſwer them to any queſtions that they in honour could de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of me,</hi> and I in conſcience return an anſwer to, <hi>alwayes provided they talked not with me as a Houſe, nor a Committee from their Houſe,</hi> for having been fighting for my Liberties and Freedoms, I proteſted unto his Lordſhip before the God of Heaven and Earth, (and ſo I wiſh'd him to tell them) that if they forced me to their Bar, <hi>I both muſt and would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt their incroachment upon the Commoners Rights, and appeal for ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice againſt them to the Houſe of Commons, although I died for it immediatly:</hi> And his Lordſhip told me, he beleeved the Houſe of Commons would not ſtand by me: and I anſwered, I was confident they would, <hi>for it was their own Intereſt;</hi> but if they would not, I told his Lordſhip, now I knew my Liberties, <hi>I would never betray them while I breathed.</hi> And this, my Lord, I tell you further, and do profeſſe it before Almighty God, that if your Houſe will not be ruled by reaſon, but by their greatneſſe think to cruſh me, and by force engage me in a conteſt againſt you, I ſo well underſtand the firmneſſe of the grounds upon which I go, <hi>that I will venture my heart bloud againſt you, and never make peace with you, till either you have deſtroyed me, or I have p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ucked you or your <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpations up by the roots.</hi> So away he went, and kept it off till about one of the clock. And, Mr. Speaker, when I was called in to their Bar, in going in I put no af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front upon them, but went bare-head, and gave them three or four con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges (with all reſpect) before I came to their Bar: where they fell a
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:116227:28"/>
playing the High Commiſſion Court with me, in examining me upon Interrogatories againſt my ſelf; which forced me to deliver in my Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt againſt them; ſo that, Mr. Speaker, I am ſure I pick'd no quarrell (nor ſought any) with them. But now, Mr. Speaker, being ſo deeply engaged againſt them by their own folly as I am, <hi>for the preſervation of the Laws and Liberties of my native Country,</hi> againſt their trampling them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their feet, in the enjoyment or practiſe of their uſurpations, I will never make peace with them while I live, <hi>but ſtudie night and day how to pluck them up by the roots;</hi> which I am confident, Mr. Speaker, is alſo the duty of this Houſe, if they will rightly and truly diſcharge their duty to the Kingdom, according to that truſt they have repoſed in them.</p>
               <p>The Reader may be pleaſed to take notice that at the Bar when I was ſpeaking of writing of Letters, I took notice of one of the prieſts <hi>poſitive Charges,</hi> which was that I had writ a Letter to Sir <hi>Anthony Weldon</hi> of <hi>Kent:</hi> which I told M. <hi>Speaker</hi> was the abſoluteſt lye in the world, for I never had a hand in the leaſt in writing or indicting a Letter to Sir <hi>Ant. Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> neither did I read or heard read any Letter unto him; But M. Speaker ſaid <hi>I, there is well nigh forty lyes more as palpable ones as this in his Relation,</hi> which I dare with confidence aver it at this bar, if I had in writing <hi>verbatim</hi> the very relation that he hath now made before this Houſe by word of mouth, (for all his confidence) that I could by multitude of witneſſes of upright life &amp; converſation in all their converſings with their neighbours, and of untainted fidelity to the Parliament and the common intereſt of the Kingdom in the worſt of times, <hi>punctually prove the greateſt port of forty abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute lyes and falſhoeds, in his preſent confident relation;</hi> and for his averring that I ſaid or it was ſaid at the meeting that we would only make uſe of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments name, <hi>and of our Petition to them, for a cloak to colour our raiſing</hi> of the people til we were ſtrong enough to deſtroy them; M. Speaker, I aver it with confidence upon my life there was no ſuch thing ſpoken at all in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid meeting, or any thing ſo much as tending thereunto all the time I was there, but the abſolute quite contrary; the truth of which I am confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent will if need require, be averred upon Oath by the generality of the whole Company then met together.</p>
               <p>And therefore Maſter Speaker I ſhall draw towards a concluſion; but being that which followed is printed at large in the 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, &amp;c. pages of the forementioned Book Calleda Whip for the preſent Houſe of Lords, I for brevities ſake ſhall here paſſe it over and refer the Reader if he pleaſes to the peruſing of it there, where alſo he will find I was like to be murthered at the Houſe door by their Guard, becauſe I would not go to priſon but by vertue of a Warrant made according to that forme the law requires all Mittimuſſes to be; but being overpoured with drawn Swords and bent Muskets, I was forced to the Tower as a pretended Traytor; And therefore to record to poſterity the deſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Meſſage from His Majeſty, I delivered to Commiſſary Generall <hi>Ireton</hi> at <hi>Colebrook,</hi> who ſeemed to receive it with joy, ſaying, <hi>That we ſhould be the verieſt Knaves that ever lived, if in every thing we made not good what ever we had promiſed,</hi> becauſe the King by his not declaring againſt us, had given us great advantage againſt our Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries.</p>
                           <p>After our marching throug <hi>London</hi> with the Army, his Majeſty being at <hi>Hampton</hi> Court, Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwel,</hi> and Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Ireton,</hi> ſent the King word ſeverall times, that the reaſon why they made no more haſt in buſineſſe, was becauſe that party which did then ſit in the Houſe while <hi>Pelham</hi> was Speaker, did much obſtruct the buſineſſe, ſo that they could not carry it on at preſent. The Lieutenant Generall often ſaying, <hi>Really they ſhould be pulled out by the ears,</hi> and to that purpoſe cauſed a Regiment of Horſe to Rendezvouz at <hi>Hide-Parke</hi> to have put that in execution as he himſelf expreſſed, <hi>had it not been carryed by Vote in the Houſe that day as he deſired:</hi> The day before, the Parliament Voted once more the ſending of the Propoſitions of both Kingdoms to the King by the Commiſſioners of each Kingdom at <hi>Hampton Court.</hi> Commiſſary Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall <hi>Ireton</hi> bade me tell the King, <hi>that ſuch a thing was to be done to morrow in the Houſe,</hi> but his Majeſty need not to be troubled at it, for they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it to no other end but to make good ſome promiſes of the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which the Nation of <hi>Scotland</hi> expected performance of: and that it was not expected or deſired his Majeſty ſhould either Sign them or Treat upon them, for which there ſhould be no advantage taken againſt the King. Upon the delivery of which Meſſage, His Majeſty replyed, he knew
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:116227:35"/>
not what Anſwer to give to pleaſe all without a Treaty. Next day after this Vote paſſed, the Lieutenant Generall asked me thereupon, If the King did not wonder at theſe Votes; I told him no: For that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary Generall <hi>Ireton,</hi> had ſent ſuch a Meſſage by me the day before the Vote paſſed, to ſignifie the reaſon of it: The Lieutenant-Generall reply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that really it was the truth, and that we (ſpeaking of the Parliament) intended nothing elſe by it, but to ſatisfie the <hi>Scots,</hi> which otherwiſe might be troubleſome. And the Lieutenant Generall, and Com. Gen. <hi>Ireton</hi> enquiring after His Majeſties Anſwer to the Propoſitions, and what it would be,<note place="margin">Nota bene.</note> 
                              <hi>it was ſhewed them both privately in a Garden-houſe in</hi> Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, <hi>and in ſome part amended to their own mind.</hi>

And rather then they would fall ſhort of what was promiſed, he would joyn with <hi>French, Spaniard, Cavalier</hi> or any that would force them to it. Upon the delivery of which Meſſage the King made Anſwer, that if they doe, they would doe more then he durſt doe. After this the delay of the ſettlement of the Kingdom was excuſed upon the Commotions of Colonel <hi>Martin,</hi> and Colonel <hi>Rainsborough</hi> with their adherents; the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant General ſaying, That ſpeedy courſe muſt be taken for putting them out of the Houſe and Army, becauſe they were now putting the Army into a Mutiny, by having hand in publiſhing ſeveral Printed Papers, calling themſelves the Agents of five Regiments, and the Agreement of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, although ſome men had encouragement from Lieutenant Generall <hi>Cromwel,</hi> for the proſecution of thoſe<note n="(f)" place="margin">See Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys projects and the <hi>2</hi> part of Englands new Chains diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, pag. <hi>6.</hi>

                              <hi>To the Honorable the choſen and betruſted Knights, Citizens, and Burgeſſes aſſembled in PARLIAMENT:</hi> The humble Petition of divers wel-affected Free-born people of England, inhabiting in and about <hi>Eaſt-Smithfield</hi> and <hi>Wapping,</hi> and other parts adjacent:</head>
                           <opener>SHEWETH,</opener>
                           <p>THat as this honourable Houſe was choſen by the people to redneſſe their grievances; ſo we conceive it our native right to meet together to frame and promote Petitions, for your better information of all ſuch things as are by experience found burthenſome and grievous to the Common-wealth, That accordingly this honorable Houſe hath declared, that it ought to receive Petitions, <hi>though againſt things eſtabliſhed by Law:</hi> That in the uſe of this our native acknowledged right we (together with Lieutenant Col. <hi>John Lilburn,</hi> and Mr <hi>John Wildman</hi>) were met together in Eaſt-Smithfield upon the 17 of <hi>January</hi> laſt, and diſcourſed upon theſe enſuing particulars, viz. <hi>Some ſcrupled the very petitioning this Houſe any more, as a thing from whence (notwithſtanding their having hazarded their lives for their Freedoms) they had hither to received nothing but reproaches and injuries, and were anſwered (by one of the perſons before-named to this effect.</hi> That it was their duty alwayes, and their wiſdome, in this juncture of time, to uſe their utmoſt diligence to procure the ſettlement of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth; and that warr, famine, and confuſion could no other way in probability be prevented. And it was generally concluded, that the moſt viſible intereſt of the people was, to uphold the Honor of this Houſe, and to preſerve it from contempt.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. There was likewiſe an occaſionall Diſcourſe about the <hi>Right of the Lords to the Law-giving power;</hi> And herein was debated the danger of ſuch an Arbitrary authority (as that is in its own nature) reſiding in any perſons during life, and much more of its deſcending as an inheritance from Generation to Generation, and ſomthing was added from our ſad experience of the miſchiefs which have enſued hereupon: In particular, it was declared, how <hi>their exerciſe of that claim might be charged in reaſon with all the precious blood that hath been ſpilt in the late War, becauſe the King had never had opportunity to Levie an Army againſt the people and Parliament, if the Lords had not deferred ſo long after many ſollicitations by the Commons to paſſe the Ordinance for ſetling the Militia.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="3">3. It was alſo accidentally wondred at, why LIEUTENANT GENERALL CROMWELL, and COMMISSARY GENERALL IRETON, ſhould <hi>now of late urge, That no more addreſſes ſhould be made to the King,</hi> whereas <hi>they have formerly pleaded,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:116227:37"/>
that he might be brought in even with his negative voice.</hi> Whereupon Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Colonell Lilburn related a ſtory, That a member of the Houſe of Commons (having information from a credible perſon, That the <hi>King had promiſed</hi> Lieutenant Gen. Cromwell, <hi>a blue Ribbond with a George, and the Earldome of</hi> Eſſex, <hi>beſides other places of honour and profit to his Son, Commiſſary Gen.</hi> Ireton <hi>reſolved) to become another</hi> Felton, <hi>rather then to ſuffer his Countrey to be ſo betrayed: But the Gentleman being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded by Friends, and intelligence hereof being ſent to the Lieutenant Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, a Faſt enſued at the Head quarters', and ſo he concurred with the Houſe in the late Vote againſt the King.</hi> Nevertheleſſe, in <hi>Mr. Wildmans opinion, he was neceſſitated into ſuch a Turn, becauſe THE SCOTS ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bid HIGHER for the King then he had done, his offer was rejected, and they relyed on.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="4">4. Some conſideration was had about proportionable aſſiſtances towards the charge of printing our Petitions.</p>
                           <p n="5">5. It being among other things enquired, whether there were any truth in this rumour, That <hi>the Lords had ſent to Lieutenant Colonell</hi> Lil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burne, <hi>and offered him</hi> 3000 l. <hi>to deſiſt in the large Petition now abroad.</hi> The Lieutenant Col. anſwered, <hi>That it was a falſe groundleſſe report,</hi> and that he knew no occaſion for it, unleſſe it were becauſe <hi>a Lord had ſent to him, to tell him, he would ſend him a token of his love, if he thought it would be accepted.</hi> To which he anſwered, <hi>That he would not be engaged to any Patentee</hi> Lord, <hi>and ſome other words to that effect.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p n="6">6. There was a relation made by a perſon, that <hi>ſome poor people in THE CO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>NTRY did meet together in Companies, and did violently take away the Corn as it was going to Market,</hi> ſaying that it was their <hi>great neceſſity cauſed them ſo to do:</hi> whereupon, we fearing leſt the calamity might be more generall, did ask how we ſhould beſt preſerve our ſelves in caſe of ſuch Tumults, becauſe we bore the names of <hi>Round heads, INDEPENDENTS,</hi> &amp;c. for adhering to the Parliament? and we ſatisfyed by Lieutenant-Colonel <hi>Lilburn</hi> to this purpoſe.
